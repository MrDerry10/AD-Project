# AD-Project

## Objective

This project involves setting up an Active Directory home lab with Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The goal is to explore how a domain environment operates, ingest events into a SIEM, and generate telemetry to analyse real-world attacks. 

### Skills Learned

-Setting up and configuring an Active Directory domain environment.
-Deploying and using Splunk for event logging and analysis.
-Understanding how to ingest events into a SIEM system.
-Conducting a brute-force attack with Kali Linux and analyzing the results.
-Utilizing Atomic Red Team to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
-Generating and analyzing telemetry data from real-world security events.
-Identifying and monitoring security incidents within a domain environment.
-Strengthening skills in cybersecurity automation and threat detection techniques.

### Tools Used

-Windows Server: For setting up and managing the Active Directory domain environment.
-Kali Linux: For conducting the brute-force attack and other penetration testing tasks.
-Splunk: For logging, monitoring, and analyzing security events.
-Atomic Red Team: For simulating real-world attack scenarios within the environment.
-VirtualBox: For creating and managing virtual machines for the home lab setup.
-Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC): For managing users and groups in the Active Directory environment.
-PowerShell: For scripting and managing tasks within the Windows Server environment.
