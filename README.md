# AD-Project

## Objective

This project involves setting up an Active Directory home lab with Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. The goal is to explore how a domain environment operates, ingest events into a SIEM, and generate telemetry to analyse real-world attacks. 

### Skills Learned

- Setting up and configuring an Active Directory domain environment.
- Deploying and using Splunk for event logging and analysis.
- Understanding how to ingest events into a SIEM system.
- Conducting a brute-force attack with Kali Linux and analyzing the results.
- Utilizing Atomic Red Team to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
- Generating and analyzing telemetry data from real-world security events.
- Identifying and monitoring security incidents within a domain environment.
- Strengthening skills in cybersecurity automation and threat detection techniques.

### Tools Used

- **Windows Server:** For setting up and managing the Active Directory domain environment.
- **Kali Linux:** For conducting the brute-force attack and other penetration testing tasks.
- **Splunk:** For logging, monitoring, and analyzing security events.
- **Atomic Red Team:** For simulating real-world attack scenarios within the environment.
- **VirtualBox:** For creating and managing virtual machines for the home lab setup.
- **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC):** For managing users and groups in the Active Directory environment.
- **PowerShell:** For scripting and managing tasks within the Windows Server environment.
